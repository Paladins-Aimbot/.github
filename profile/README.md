## 🎯 What Is the Paladins Aimbot?

The Paladins Aimbot is a **high-performance external or injected aim assist** that snaps your crosshair directly onto enemy hitboxes—instantly. Whether you're playing DPS, flanker, or even supports with skill shots, this tool gives you total control over aim behavior.

It can run silent and smooth for stealth play, or go full-blown aggressive with rapid locks and max FOV for rage lobbies. 💪
